        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Gorditas are a Mexican dish, consisting of a thicker wrap with different kinds of fillings, made from corn flour. They are either cooked in oil or on a griddle.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ¼ cups instant corn masa flour, the more authentic the better</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>½ cup water, or as needed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine corn masa flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Add a little water at a time until a firm dough forms. Divide dough into equal pieces and roll between your hands to form small balls. Press dough into 1/4-inch circles.</li>
            <li>Heat a griddle or comal over medium heat. Add dough circles to the hot griddle and cook until light brown, slightly inflated, and cooked on the outsides, about 3 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry gorditas in batches, if necessary, until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels and serve hot.</li>
            <li>Add your favorite fillings and enjoy!!</li>
